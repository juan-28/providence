        <h1>RNAseq Data Analysis of Pancreatic Cancer Patients</h1>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to analyze RNAseq data from pancreatic cancer patients to identify genetic markers linked
            to immune response. The analysis involves multiple stages, including data quality assessment, feature
            engineering, and the development of machine learning models to identify key genes and patterns.</p>

        <h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>
        -- TODO: Add way more info and findings here with some background knowledge and a bit more of a deep dive in the
        statistics
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetic Marker Identification:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzed RNAseq data from pancreatic cancer patients.</li>
                    <li>Identified genetic markers linked to immune response using feature selection with Random Forest
                        and regression models.</li>
                    <li> TODO: Add Random Forest Results and any visualizations. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Quality and Feature Engineering:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted data quality assessment and feature engineering within a Python-based OOP framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>Applied transformation techniques and variability filtering to mitigate noise and batch effects,
                        enhancing the reliability of downstream analysis.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate gene expression patterns and
                        their associations.</li>
                    <li>These visualizations facilitated a clearer understanding of complex genetic data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <p>The project serves as a foundational effort to identify genetic markers responsible for tumor invasion.
            Initially modeled with 48 samples, the analysis has been expanded to include over 500 samples from The
            Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additional cross-validation methods are being implemented to ensure robust
            findings.</p>

        <h2>Ongoing Work</h2>
        <p>Continued development and refinement of machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy and uncover
            significant patterns in the data. The attached Jupyter Notebook file (<code>.ipynb</code>) provides an
            in-depth look at the methods and preliminary results. Please note that this is a work in progress, and
            further enhancements are underway.</p>

        <h2>How to Use This Repository</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong>
                <p>Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can find the required packages in the
                    <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Running the Analysis:</strong>
                <p>Open the Jupyter Notebook (<code>.ipynb</code>) to explore the data analysis workflow. Follow the
                    steps outlined in the notebook to understand the data preprocessing, feature selection, and
                    visualization techniques applied.</p>
